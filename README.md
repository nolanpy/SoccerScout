# SoccerScout

SoccerScout is a tool for soccer clubs to identify undervalued and overvalued players by analyzing advanced statistics and comparing predicted values to actual market values.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add ML models to predict market values
- [ ] Compare predicted vs. actual values
- [ ] Track prediction accuracy over time
- [ ] Add more visualization tools

## Overview

This application analyzes player performance using a comprehensive set of advanced statistics including:

- Expected goals (xG) and assists (xA)
- Shot-creating actions (SCA) and goal-creating actions (GCA)
- Progressive passes and carries
- Defensive metrics like tackles, interceptions, and pressures
- Physical and tactical data

The current version uses simulated player data in a SQLite database, with plans to integrate with real-world APIs and implement machine learning models.

## Features

- **Player Performance Scoring**: Calculate weighted performance scores based on 30+ advanced metrics
- **Market Value Comparison**: Compare performance to market value to identify undervalued/overvalued players
- **Interactive UI**: Filter and search for players, view detailed statistics
- **Data Visualization**: View statistical distributions across metrics

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLite, Pandas
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
- **Data**: Simulated soccer statistics database with 20+ players and 3 seasons of data

## Machine Learning Implementation

SoccerScout now includes a comprehensive machine learning system to predict player market values and identify undervalued talent:

1. **Position-Specific Models**:

   - Separate models for forwards, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers
   - Position-appropriate weighting of statistics (offensive vs. defensive)
   - Accounts for position-specific market dynamics (forwards typically cost more)
   - Falls back to general model when position-specific data is limited

2. **Age-Adjusted Evaluation**:

   - Incorporates player age into market value predictions
   - Models peak value curve (typically around age 27)
   - Boosts values for young players showing high performance (potential)
   - Accounts for declining values in older players
   - Enables meaningful comparisons between players of different ages

3. **Multiple ML Algorithms**:

   - Random Forest Regressor (default)
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - Ridge Regression
   - Lasso Regression

4. **Historical Data Analysis**:

   - Uses 6 seasons of data (2018-2023) to train models
   - Predicts current season (2023-2024) market values
   - Evaluates prediction accuracy season-by-season
   - Improves models by learning from historical trends

5. **Feature Importance Analysis**:

   - Identifies which statistics most strongly correlate with market value
   - Automatically adjusts statistical weights based on ML insights
   - Generates optimal weights for the player evaluation algorithm
   - Tailors importance by position (goals matter more for forwards, tackles for defenders)

6. **Model Performance Metrics**:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R² Score (coefficient of determination)
   - Season-by-season trend analysis

## ML Metrics Explained

### R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

- **What it means**: R² measures how well the model's predictions explain the variation in the actual player market values.
- **Interpretation**: Ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 means perfect prediction.
- **Practical value**: Higher R² indicates the model better captures what determines a player's market value.

### RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

- **What it means**: The square root of the average squared difference between predicted and actual market values.
- **Interpretation**: Lower is better; shows the average magnitude of prediction errors in the same units as market value (euros).
- **Practical value**: Helps scouts understand the expected margin of error in predictions.

### MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

- **What it means**: The average absolute difference between predicted and actual market values.
- **Interpretation**: Lower is better; more intuitive than RMSE as it's a direct average of errors.
- **Practical value**: Easier for non-technical users to understand - "on average, predictions are off by €X million".

### Percentage Error

- **What it means**: The average percentage by which predictions differ from actual values.
- **Interpretation**: Lower is better; helpful for comparing errors across players with different market values.
- **Practical value**: Helps identify whether predictions are more accurate for high or low-value players.

### Value Ratio

- **What it means**: The ratio of predicted value to actual market value.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Ratio > 1.5: Player is undervalued (worth more than market price)
  - 0.7 <= Ratio <= 1.5: Fair value
  - Ratio < 0.7: Player is overvalued (worth less than market price)
- **Practical value**: The core metric for talent scouts to identify market inefficiencies and potential bargains.

### Feature Importance

- **What it means**: Indicates which player statistics most heavily influence market value predictions.
- **Interpretation**: Higher values indicate greater impact on player valuation.
- **Practical value**: Helps scouts understand which skills and statistics truly drive player market values.

## Performance Tracking and Comparison

The system now includes comprehensive tools to track and compare model performance across different datasets and configurations:

1. **Performance Logging**

   - Detailed logs of training process and metrics
   - Standardized metrics format for easy comparison
   - Timestamps and configuration details preserved

2. **Metrics Storage**

   - JSON-based storage of model metrics
   - Organized by model type and custom tags
   - Preserves data characteristics for context

3. **Run Tagging**

   - Tag each training run (e.g., "baseline", "more_data", "real_data")
   - Compare performance between specific tagged runs
   - Track progress over time with sequential tags

4. **Before/After Comparison**
   - Direct comparison of key metrics (R², RMSE, MAE)
   - Percentage improvements calculated automatically
   - Overall assessment of model improvement

### How to Track Performance When Adding Data

1. First, establish a baseline:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000/train-model?tag=baseline
   ```

2. After adding more data, create a new tagged run:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000/train-model?tag=more_data
   ```

3. Compare the performance:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000/compare-model-runs?baseline_tag=baseline&comparison_tag=more_data
   ```

4. Analyze the metrics to see how your data additions impacted performance

## Data Collection Ethics and Legality

### FBref Data Scraping

SoccerScout uses data from FBref.com for player statistics. My data collection approach is designed to be ethical and respectful:

1. **Rate Limiting**: My scraper implements proper rate limiting with random delays between requests (3-6 seconds) to avoid overloading FBref's servers.

2. **Respectful Access**: I follow robots.txt guidelines and only access publicly available data that doesn't require authentication.

3. **Minimal Requests**: I cache results and only request pages when necessary, minimizing server load.

4. **Attribution**: I clearly credit FBref as the data source and do not claim ownership of their data.

5. **No Competitive Product**: I am not creating a competitive product to FBref, only using their data for analysis.

6. **User-Agent Declaration**: I use a proper User-Agent string to identify my scraper.

I follow best practices to ensure my activities remain ethical and sustainable. For production use at larger scale, purchasing data from official providers like Opta or Wyscout would be implemented.
